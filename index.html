        <p>Hello! My name is Harsh, and lately, I’ve developed a deep passion for cooking. This website is a place where I showcase some of the meals I’ve prepared, along with my experiences in the kitchen. Cooking has become an exciting and creative outlet for me, allowing me to experiment with different flavors, ingredients, and techniques while making meals that suit my dietary needs.</p>
        
        <p>One important aspect of my cooking journey is that I have dietary restrictions—I am unable to eat gluten, dairy, eggs, and nuts. Because of this, all the recipes and meals featured on this website are completely free of these ingredients, along with a few others that I avoid. At first, navigating these dietary restrictions felt challenging, but over time, I’ve learned how to adapt and create delicious, satisfying meals without sacrificing taste or variety.</p>
        
        <p>From hearty homemade meals to quick and simple snacks, I focus on using fresh, wholesome ingredients that bring out bold flavors and rich textures. My goal is to share these creations with others who may have similar dietary needs or simply want to explore allergen-free cooking. I hope this website inspires you to try new things in the kitchen!</p>
