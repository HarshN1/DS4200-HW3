        <p>Hello! My name is Harsh. Lately I have enjoyed cooking and this website showcases some of the stuff I have made alongside a personal reflection of how the food was and some of my takeaways from each experience. Just as a prelude, I do have dietary restrictions and am unable to eat Gluten, Dairy, Eggs, and Nuts, so all meals on this page avoid those and a few others ingredients too.</p>
